## React Roguelike: A Procedural Dungeon Adventure

The React Roguelike is a classic, procedurally generated dungeon crawler where each floor offers new challenges and surprises. Created with **React** and **Redux**, this game combines strategy with exploration, encouraging players to carefully balance leveling up and gathering resources to ultimately face off against a powerful final boss.

### Project Overview

Designed as a true roguelike, React Roguelike generates unique dungeon layouts for each playthrough, ensuring no two games are alike. The player begins on the first floor of the dungeon, navigating through procedurally generated rooms and corridors filled with enemies, health boosts, and weapon upgrades. The goal? To reach the final floor and take down the boss—but success requires careful preparation and patience, as charging ahead without leveling up could mean facing overwhelming odds.

### Technical Highlights

This project leverages **React** for component-based game elements and **Redux** for managing the game state, providing a smooth and modular gameplay experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: The game’s levels are created procedurally, creating unique environments with every playthrough.
- **Progression and Power-Ups**: Players must level up and collect resources, balancing risk and reward as they prepare to face the final boss.
- **Minimalist Graphics**: All game elements are represented as colored squares, creating a simple yet visually engaging style.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: With strategic turn-based mechanics, players make decisions on each move, ensuring every action counts.

### Gameplay Mechanics

**Starting from the Bottom**
Players enter at the first dungeon level and make their way up, facing progressively more challenging enemies. The goal is to explore each floor, gather items, and strengthen your character. Avoid being too hasty—failing to gather enough power-ups or level up can lead to a difficult fight against the final boss.

**Strategic Leveling and Resource Gathering**
Victory requires patience and strategy. As players navigate through the dungeon, they’ll encounter enemies that reward experience points upon defeat, health potions for healing, and powerful weapons. These resources become essential for survival as the enemies become tougher on each floor.

**Challenging the Boss**
After making your way through multiple dungeon levels, you’ll reach the final floor, where a powerful boss awaits. This climactic encounter tests your preparation and tactical decisions—only players who have carefully balanced leveling and resource management will emerge victorious.
