## ABOUT

This project is a [roguelike game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike). It has procedurally generated levels, so no two playthroughs are the same. You start on the first floor and must make your way up to the final floor to defeat the boss. If you are too hasty in your efforts, you may find yourself outmatched by his strength. Be sure to level up, and collect health and weapons to ensure victory.
