## Starcraft 2 AI Bots: Custom AI for Every Race

This project brings Starcraft 2 to life with a trio of custom AI bots, each designed to play as one of the game’s three races: Terran, Protoss, and Zerg. Leveraging the official Blizzard Starcraft 2 API, each AI operates using a unique set of strategies crafted from simple, rule-based algorithms. The bots are capable of competing against one another, against Blizzard’s built-in AI at various difficulty levels, and even against human players, similarly to DeepMind’s AlphaStar.

### Project Overview

Each bot in the Starcraft 2 AI Bots series is tailored to its race, implementing strategies that reflect the strengths and unique gameplay styles of Terran, Protoss, and Zerg. Designed with a focus on adaptability and strategic depth, the AI can handle diverse in-game scenarios and make calculated decisions in real-time. As a hobby project, this series serves as a platform for exploring the complexities of real-time strategy AI development.

### Technical Highlights

The bots utilize **Blizzard's official Starcraft 2 API**, which provides essential tools for managing in-game units, resources, and environmental awareness. Each bot’s strategy relies on straightforward rules but builds upon them to adapt to the opponent’s moves and game state.

**Key Features:**

- **Race-Specific AI**: Three individual AIs designed specifically for each Starcraft 2 race:
  - **Terran AI**: Implements aggressive tactics with a focus on mobile units and quick expansion.
  - **Protoss AI**: Optimizes powerful, high-cost units with defensive strategies and precision attacks.
  - **Zerg AI (BalancedZergBot)**: Prioritizes swarm tactics and rapid resource gathering, capable of defeating the hardest non-cheating Blizzard AI.
- **Real-Time Debugging & Visualization**: Through the API, the bots include graphical debugging tools, an automatic camera that tracks the action, and real-time stats plotting via **Matplotlib**.
- **Versatile Match Modes**: The AIs can compete against each other, the built-in Blizzard AI, or human players, allowing for a wide range of testing scenarios.

### Spotlight on BalancedZergBot

Among the three, **BalancedZergBot** is the most developed and has demonstrated consistent success against the hardest non-cheating Blizzard AI. This bot showcases advanced tactical responses, including defensive formations, counter-attacks, and efficient resource management. The bot also has built-in debugging tools, such as an auto-adjusting camera that keeps gameplay in focus and real-time match data visualization with **Matplotlib**.
