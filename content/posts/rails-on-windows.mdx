## Setting Up Ruby on Rails on Windows

Setting up Rails on Windows can be a straightforward process with tools like [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and `msys2`. This guide walks you through the installation of Ruby, Rails, and all necessary dependencies, so you can start developing Rails applications locally on Windows.

---

## Step 1: Installing Ruby with Scoop

First, use Scoop to install `ruby`, a simple and efficient package manager for Windows.

```bash
scoop install ruby
```

Once installed, Scoop will prompt you to add the `msys2` toolchain, which is essential for managing Windows dependencies.

### Step 2: Install `msys2`

Now, install `msys2` using Scoop to ensure your environment has access to crucial build tools.

```bash
scoop install msys2
```

After this step, you'll have a compatible Ruby environment ready for Rails setup.

---

## Step 3: Setting Up `ridk`

To further configure `msys2`, use the `ridk` tool included with Ruby to finalize installation. Run these commands in order:

```bash
ridk install
```

Then enable the environment:

```bash
ridk enable
```

With this, you’re ready to install Rails.

---

## Step 4: Installing Rails

Now you can install Rails using RubyGems:

```bash
gem install rails
```

If all went well, you should now have both `ruby` and `rails` installed.

### Checking Versions

Verify your installation by checking the Ruby and Rails versions:

```bash
ruby --version
# Expected Output: ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x64-mingw32]

rails --version
# Expected Output: Rails 6.0.3.2
```

---

## Step 5: Building Your First Rails Application

With Ruby and Rails installed, let’s create a Rails application to confirm everything is working correctly.

1. Scaffold a new Rails app by running:

```bash
rails new hello-rails
```

   This command generates all the necessary files and installs your app's dependencies.

2. Navigate into the app directory:

```bash
cd hello-rails
```

3. Start the Rails server:

```bash
rails s
```

Your Rails application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000/`. Open this URL in your browser to see the default Rails welcome page.
