## Installation

I used [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) to install `ruby`.

```bash
scoop install ruby
```

Then I installed `msys2` as recommended in the output from the above command.

```bash
scoop install msys2
```

Then I used

```bash
ridk install
```

then

```bash
ridk enable
```

then I installed `rails`.

```bash
gem install rails
```

ðŸŽ‰ at this point you should have `ruby`

```bash
ruby --version
ruby 2.7.1p83 (2020-03-31 revision a0c7c23c9c) [x64-mingw32]
```

and `rails`

```bash
rails --version
Rails 6.0.3.2
```

## Hello Rails

Time to build your first rails application, let's scaffold our new app with

```bash
rails new hello-rails
```

rails will generate your project files and install your dependencies. Then cd into the new directory

```bash
cd hello-rails
```

and run your first rails app

```bash
rails s
```

this should start your rails app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
